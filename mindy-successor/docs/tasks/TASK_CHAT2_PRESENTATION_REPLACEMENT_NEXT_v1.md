# TASK CHAT 2 — Presentation Replacement Continuation v1

Status: ACTIVE / CONTINUOUS.
Base: completed `chat2/presentation-production-plan-next`.
Previous checkpoint is frozen for Lead review.

Do not edit Lead-owned shared runtime/schema/build/UI while `lead/product-activation-school-lumber-v2` is active.

## Queue item 1 — replacement-bundle acceptance fixture

Create NEW files only:
- `prior-work/astra/prototype-m3.2/content/presentation-replacement-bundle.fixture.json`
- `prior-work/astra/prototype-m3.2/tests/presentation-replacement-bundle.test.ts`

Using the completed production patch plan, define a portable replacement bundle keyed only by semantic `presentationId`.

For every Lumber/School/Forest/ending slot that has a future GIF target:
- semantic presentationId;
- current fallback media id/path;
- future GIF logical target name;
- whether static fallback is mandatory;
- whether text fallback is available.

Verify:
- no absolute/user filesystem paths;
- no mechanics/effects/RNG/Energy/save-state fields;
- duplicate semantic IDs reject;
- unknown IDs reject/quarantine in preflight;
- changing replacement media never changes gameplay/event/course/ending identity.

## Queue item 2 — drop-in replacement regression matrix

Create NEW files only:
- `prior-work/astra/prototype-m3.2/content/presentation-replacement-regression.fixture.json`
- `prior-work/astra/prototype-m3.2/tests/presentation-replacement-regression.test.ts`

Cover representative replacements for:
- Lumber seasonal shift;
- Lumber milestone;
- Foreman relationship/Night;
- Forest Activity;
- two School courses from different stat families;
- Hard Work ending.

For each, assert:
- semantic presentationId before/after replacement is identical;
- current static fallback remains valid if GIF missing;
- animations-off chooses a non-animated candidate without changing mechanics;
- save/reload identity remains event/course/ending-driven;
- replacement bundle cannot mutate gameplay content.

Do not edit `content/presentation.json`, shared presentation runtime, editor, or UI.

After item 1 commit immediately continue to item 2 without waiting for Lead review.
